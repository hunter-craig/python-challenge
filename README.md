# python-challenge
So for this challenge i found pandas to be extremely helpful and useful. i did have issues with finding a script that would export the files to a txt though. 
i had to do things a little strange at times but i attribute that to me missing a piece of knowledge that would have been more streamlined but what i have still worked
